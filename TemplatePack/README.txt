This is the template texture pack!
You can change the game's midis, textures, and audio files, as long as you know the names!
Check the core texture pack to find those, but don't change the core texture pack directly.
It will very likely be overwritten.
Textures only supports PNG, and Audio supports multiple file types, but I suggest sticking to wav.
Subtitles.json allows you to replace subtitles, works the same as the standard subtitle files, just no need to include every key.
Note about MIDIS: Not all instruments are available in BB+! Don't report this as a bug!
If this mod ever gets a version format bump, you will have to edit the Version variable in pack.json to be able to use it!
Speaking of pack.json...

Pack.json contains all the mod display stuff, name, description, author, etc.
It's a bit barren right now, but there may be more in the future!
